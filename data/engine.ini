[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1			; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.120					; engine inertia
LIMITER=6500					; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=30					; Frequency of engine limiter

RPM=7000						; rev number reference
TORQUE=110						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.99						; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.994					; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=2.0 					; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=1.8					; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=1.8			; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=3000				; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=2.5						; Turbo pressure sensitivity on accelerator pedal
